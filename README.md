## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for my project. It's a user-friendly wireframing tool that enables me to quickly and easily create mockups for my website or application. It offers a wide range of pre-built UI elements, and allows for easy collaboration with my team. I linked a pdf of my wireframes, which you can access it and check it out the design, layout and the flow of the project before implementing it in the real product.

## AWS 

I am using AWS S3 buckets to store my data. S3 is a highly scalable and durable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows me to easily store and retrieve large amounts of data, and its built-in security features provide added protection for my files. I chose S3 for its scalability, durability, and security features.

## Database

I built my database with Python and the Django framework using PostgreSQL for the deployed Heroku version (production). It's a powerful and open-source object-relational database system that is known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. I chose it because it provides a flexible tool for efficiently managing and organizing my data.

## Features  


### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
I have used meta tags in the HTML of my web app's pages to optimize them for search engines. The description tag provides a brief summary of the content on the page, while the keywords tag lists relevant keywords to help search engines understand the content of the webpage and its relevance to related search queries.

## Accessibility  
The [WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards.  
- All pages returned 0 errors.
- I have added sr only tags throught the website to ensure that the website is accessible
- There are contrast errors, there is not a dark enough orange to have white text, I have decided to change the color as dark as I can but these contrast errors still exist
- To suit the them of my website I'm keeping the orange color
- All alerts presented were for redundant links whichweres taken into account during development.

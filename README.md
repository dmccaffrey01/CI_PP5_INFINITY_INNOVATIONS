## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for my project. It's a user-friendly wireframing tool that enables me to quickly and easily create mockups for my website or application. It offers a wide range of pre-built UI elements, and allows for easy collaboration with my team. I linked a pdf of my wireframes, which you can access it and check it out the design, layout and the flow of the project before implementing it in the real product.
